# R3DVanilla
Minecraft plugin that adds various features specifically designed for the Everneth server.

## Features
 **Single-player sleep** - Allows only 1 person to sleep the night away, if you wish it to stay night time then you can click the announcement message in the chat to kick out anyone that is in a bed. This will also enable a sleep vote that will require half the server (by default) to skip the night.
 
 **In-game notes** - Save information in-game with a command and view them at any time. You can add up to 10 notes (by default) and delete ones you don't want.
 >/note add \<note\>
 >/note delete \<note number\>
 >/note view
 
 **Portal calculator** - Easily see where to build your portal in the nether or the overworld (depending on what dimension youâ€™re in).
 >/portal
 
 **AFK detector** - After 5 minutes (by default) the server will make you in-game as AFK, this will send a message in the chat and change your name in the tab menu to include an AFK suffix at the end of your name. It will also unmark you as AFK when you move or interact with the world. You can also use the command to mark or unmark yourself.
 >/afk
 
 **Revamped private messages** - Better private messages with revamped colors for easy reading, a sound notification when you receive a message, and a quick reply to the last person that messaged you. You can also enable or disable the sound notification with a command.
 >/message \<player\> \<message\>
 >Different aliases: /msg /m /whisper /w /tell
 >/reply \<message\>
 >Different alias: /r
 >/messageping
 
 **Anti-Enderman grief** - Stops endermen from picking up blocks.
